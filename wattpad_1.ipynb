    "Hands Across Hawthorne was a rally held at the Hawthorne Bridge in the American West Coast city of Portland, Oregon, on May 29, 2011. The demonstration was in response to an attack, one week earlier, on Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear, a gay male couple who had been holding hands while walking across the bridge. According to the couple and the Portland Police Bureau, a group of five men followed Forkner and Rosevear along the bridge before physically assaulting them. The assault was condemned by Portland's mayor, Sam Adams, and its police chief, Mike Reese, and news of the attack spread throughout the Pacific Northwest and the United States. The attack prompted volunteers from the Q Center, a nonprofit organization that supports the LGBT community, to form street patrols as a means of monitoring Portland's downtown area.\n",
    "Several LGBT and human rights organizations sponsored Hands Across Hawthorne in response to the attack, with the purpose of linking hands across the entire span of the Hawthorne Bridge to show solidarity. More than 4,000 people attended the rally, which had been publicized on a single Facebook page 72 hours previously. Forkner, Rosevear, Mayor Adams, and other community leaders spoke at the rally. The event received attention throughout the United States. On June 5, residents of Spokane, Washington, held a similar hand-holding rally called \"Hands Across Monroe\", crossing the Monroe Street Bridge in Riverfront Park.\n",

      "20000 Thank you, \"You look amazing,\" He said. His eyes scanned over my body. I, once again, crossed my arms self conciously. \"Unfold your arms, you look gorgeous.\" Maddie laughed, skipping into the kitchen. \"Shut up, Mad.\" \"I agree with her,\" Mason smiled. \"Thank you,\" I blushed. \"You two have fun, and remember, you need to be safe.\" I grabbed a pillow from the couch and threw it at Maddie. She caught it mid-air and tossed it back onto the couch. I pulled the door closed, and right before it clicked, I heard Maddi scream, \"Heard that!\" \"Thank you,\" I smiled, \"Ready? Let's get away from Maddi.\" \"Yupp, you did. Smooth one,\" Maddie laughed. \"Did I just say that outloud?\" He asked slowly. I spun around and smiled at him. \"You'd stillbe beautiful without the makeup, Sophie.\" Mason informed me. \"Don't touch it.\" I growled. \"Watch it, Soph. I know where you keep your makeup!\" Thank you for everyone's support! Don't forget to VOTE, COMMMMMENT!, and TELL YOUR FRIENDS! xoxo, p.s., that was a prologue. this is chapter one; hope you love it a lottt&lt;3 ****  \"Madddddddie!\" I screamed, banging my fist against the door. \"Shut up!\" A voice screamed back. \"Madeline, I'm late!\" I screamed again. \"Shut up, Sophie!\" She laughed, swinging the door open. I stepped into the bathroom and grabbed my makeup from the counter.I gently push my body against hers, shoving her out of the way. She laughed. \"What are you getting all dressed up for, Soph?\" Maddi asked. Her eyes scanned over my outfit. I was wearing a grey and white dress with greyleggings underneath. I crossed my arms over my chest self conciously. \"A date,\" \"With who?\" \"Don't laugh,\" \"Never,\" \"Mason Wright,\" \"Ohhh, he's cute!\" \"Yeah, I guess.\" \"When did he ask you out?\" \"Yesterday,\" \"And you didn't tell your best friend?\" \"You're my roommate..\" \"Hurtful,\" She pouted, crossing her arms. \"Aw, you know I love you,\" I hugged her. In all honesty, Maddi really was my best friend. We went to the same high school, but never really talked, up until the end of senior year. We got really close and decided we'd have a lot of fun if we were roommates. Last year, as college freshman, was amazing, and I'm looking forward to this year. \"So, you're dating Mr. Wright?\" \"We're not dating. We're going on a date. There isa difference, Mads.\" \"I know, Soph. You think he's the one?\" \"Can I go out with the guy first?\" I laughed. I fixed my makeup as the doorbell rang loudly. \"I'm coming!\" Maddie screamed, rushing to the door. I could hear them talking. \"Hey Mason!\" I interrupted, stepping out of the bathroom. He was wearing a dark grey polo and dark jeans. He ran his fingers through his beautiful brown hair and smiled at me. \"Wow,\" \"Good wow or bad wow?\" I joked. \"Good. Definitely good.\"\n"
